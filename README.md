My journey is fueled by curiosity and a desire to master the art of querying, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. Through hands-on practice and real-world datasets, I aim to build a robust skill set that empowers me to tackle complex data challenges. Join me as I document my progress, share insights, and showcase my growing expertise in SQL. Let's dive into the data-driven world together!
## Day 1: SQL Basics
### Topics
Introduction to Databases: Understanding tables, rows, and columns.
SQL Syntax: Basic query structure.
Data Types: Common SQL data types.
Basic SELECT Queries: Using SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT.
Practice Queries
Problem Statement: Retrieve All Olympic Data
SQL Query:
  -- Fetch all data from the Olympics table
  use PracticeDatabase
  SELECT * FROM olympics;
Explanation: This query retrieves all columns and rows, providing a complete dataset view.
Problem Statement: Select Countries with More Than 20 Gold Medals
SQL Query:
  -- Find countries with more than 20 gold medals
  SELECT Country, Gold FROM olympics WHERE Gold > 20;
Explanation: Filters countries with more than 20 gold medals.
Problem Statement: Order Countries by Total Medals
SQL Query:
  -- Sort countries by total medals in descending order
  SELECT Country, Total FROM olympics ORDER BY Total DESC;
Explanation: Sorts countries by total medals in descending order.
Problem Statement: Display the top 5 countries with the most silver medals.
SQL Query:
  -- Retrieve the top 5 countries with the highest number of silver medals
  SELECT TOP 5 Country, Silver FROM olympics ORDER BY Silver DESC;
Explanation: This query uses TOP 5 to limit the results to the top 5 countries, sorted by silver medals in descending order.
Problem Statement: Order countries by the total number of medals in ascending order.
SQL Query:
  -- Sort countries by total medals in ascending order
  SELECT Country, Total FROM olympics ORDER BY Total ASC;
Explanation: The ORDER BY Total ASC clause sorts the countries by total medals in ascending order.
Problem Statement: Identify countries that have won fewer than 10 total medals.
SQL Query:
  -- Find countries with fewer than 10 total medals
  SELECT Country, Total FROM olympics WHERE Total < 10;
Explanation: The WHERE Total < 10 condition filters the results to include only countries with fewer than 10 total medals.
Problem Statement: Find countries with fewer than 10 total medals or where the total is null.
SQL Query:
  -- Include countries with fewer than 10 medals or null values
  SELECT Country, Total FROM olympics WHERE Total < 10 OR Total IS NULL;
Explanation: The OR Total IS NULL condition ensures that countries with null total medals are also included in the results.
